# Hospital Management System 
### Integrating patient information in an easier, more efficient way. 


This project, is a solution that me and @ElementO2512 are aiming to create to assist hospitals with data integration across different sectors within the Australian healthcare. 

> Why use different apps, softwares and systems when we can integrate and combine it into one, easy to access system.

## So what does our system do? 

As we are developing this system, we will connect and integrate patient data across different sectors of the public health system, making it easier for GP, nurses, doctors, etc to access all information in one unified system. 

## Why are we making this?

1. Based on primary sources, we found out that certain hospitals within Queensland still use pen and paper to manage patient information and health. Whilst this may be preferred to some, this system is outdated and having to share paperwork with other nurses and team members on the go is tedious.

2. Most electronical medical records developed for Australian hospitals are US based, thus they are not 100% aligned with Australian medical standards and systems.
